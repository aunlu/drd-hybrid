  Included Software

   DRD is implemented as java agent, i.e. it's executed in same JVM with target application.
  It dynamically tracks various events in program and finds apparent and potential data races during its execution.
  Race reports and other information are logged into log-files.
  For every detected race additional information is printed (stack traces, race target, etc.) to help to detect and fix race in source code.

  Using DRD
  -------------

  The profiled application should be run with "-javaagent:drd_agent.jar" JVM argument.
  Do not rename agent file "drd_agent.jar"!!!
